This manual was written with younger ages in mind,
kids with no prior programming experience should be able to use this manual
to learn about programming concepts and become proficient in Arduino BASIC,
as well as learn the quirks of the Smart Response XE device.

I wrote this manual to be printed out in a booklet.

The printed book was designed to be about the size of the Smart Response XE device.
Each page is 1/4 of a standard sheet of printer paper.

There are undoubtedly errors in the Manual, and things that I left out.
I wrote it in a rush for my nephew's christmas present, but in the future I want to improve on it
with better program examples and wording of my explanations of things.

The original document is a Google doc, if anyone is interested I can share it.
